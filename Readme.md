PlanarJS
=====

A lightweight JS library to work with planar ( 2D ) coordinates.

It supports the following coordinate systems :
* Cartesian ( complete )
* Polar ( complete )
* Geographic ( soon )

### Announcements
22/05/2014 17:35 - The library is now usable in a CommonJS environment and is fully test-covered. Version bump to 0.2.0 to reflect the actual implementation design and specs. Check test/spec.js for details on how to use it.
The documentation for a proper use is coming soon !

### TODO :

* Provide events for listening to changes in coordinates
* Wrap all coordinate systems in one object
* DONE - Implement conversion functions between coordinate systems
* Implement facilities for computing distances between points
